* Kod 2, which collects all the predictions from the 4 CNNs of the lower level
* Kod 3, which synchronise the training and test sets of the lower level classifiers
* Kod 4, which trains the classifiers of the higher level
* Kod 5, which presents how the trained system works on a real-life uploaded data
